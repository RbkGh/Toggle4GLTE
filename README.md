# Toggle4GLTE
Lock Network To 3G/4G/2G especially when your samsung droid has disabled this function


Accidentally installed korea rom after trying to update shv-e250l to lollipop.Korea rom disables functionality for locking network 
to 3g/4g/2g and my location is able to get 3g only when its locked to "WCDMA only",hence the birth of Toggle4GLTE.
